## Introduction

This Rust simulation program implements a hexagonal lattice model for simulating physical systems. It includes modules for plotting simulation data, running batch tests with varying parameters, and analyzing order parameters in the simulated system.

## Dependencies

The program relies on the following external crates:

- `rand`: A crate for random number generation.
- `plotters`: A crate for plotting data.

## Usage

To use the program, you need to have Rust installed on your system. You can build and run the simulation by executing the following commands in the terminal:
